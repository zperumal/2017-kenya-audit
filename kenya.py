# Prototype code for Bayesian audits of Kenyan election

"""
Context: 

Each precinct returns a 'Form 34A' that has tally of votes.
There is also a secondary means (e.g. from video) for getting a tally.
We'll do a variant of Bayesian comparison audit, and see if reported outcome 
is confirmed.

This routine takes as input:

   (1) A CSV file 'sites.csv' that gives, for each site (polling-site):
        (a) its 'Polling Site ID'
        (b) its 'County ID'
        (c) the number of registered voters for that pollsite 'Number voters'
        (d) the number voting for each candidate according to form 34A.

   (2) A CSV file 'audit.csv' that gives, for the sampled sites:
        (a) its 'Polling Site ID'
        (b) the number voting for each candidate in the photo/video.
       (Here "sampled" means obtaining the counts from the photo/video evidence.)

   See the associated sample data files.

This module produces an estimate of the probability (in a Bayesian sense) that
each candidate would win the election, if all sites were sampled.
